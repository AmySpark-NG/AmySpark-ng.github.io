# AmySpark's website thingy ✨
I'm not quite the most professional person in this world BUT i do like learning some things, so i made this kind of personal website-portfolio-presentation thingy as a form of learning HTML, CSS and JS, hope you like it :) i inverted a lot of time on the front-end and CSS styling

Btw, this is a long-term project, which means that it's getting updated "constantly" or at least a lot of times in the past, so yeah 

Additional little temporal note: The link colors will be "deleted" and be replaced for icons in the future, sorry if they hurt your eyes or look ugly :(

<summary>Why is it OMORI themed?</summary>

As a little parenthesis i wanted to add is tell you why is it OMORI themed, it's very simple, i just like omori, i find it very nice and pretty, i love the colors, characters and story, even tho as for now (03/26/2022) i have only played 3 hours of the game i still love a lot of things about it, i just hope i don't get copyrighted or some thing like that lOL
