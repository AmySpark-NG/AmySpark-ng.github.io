<summary>-Why is it Omori-themed?</summary>
As a little parenthesis i felt like this was something i needed "specify" and it's why is it omori themed, well it's just because as stated on the old version of the page, i like pretty things and i find omori very pretty, as for now (03/15/22) i have played only 3 hours of omori and i still don't know the story, but i really like the style and overall feeling of it, i hope i don't get "copyrighted" or something LOL
